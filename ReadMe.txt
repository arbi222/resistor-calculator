This app is a calculator that is used to calculate the resistance of resistors that use color codes. 

Therefore, the first three bands indicate the significant digits, 
the fourth band is the multiplication factor, and the fifth band represents the tolerance.

If the resistor doesn't have a third band, 
you just simply don't need to select any color on the third band.
